			<h2>About the project</h2>
			<p className="intro">
				When Hinoki Noodle Soup first opened up in 2016 it was the first ramen restaurant in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. While busy with opening up and getting into the business, the owners hadn’t yet put much thought into the identity of their brand besides that it should have a strong Japanese feeling.
				This vague idea continued to flow into the design of the old homepage that was put together swiftly back then. After the designs were done, I put together a simple prototype with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

				The old website was a standard template which sped up the design process but didn’t allow for a lot of customisation. The tricky part for me was trying to incorporate Hinoki’s current brand that they’ve developed into the design which I would describe as oriental, warm, casual, sincere and masculine.
				In order to create the same vibe as the restaurant, I incorporated a lot of the restaurant’s elements into the webdesign. I went with a dark theme with a lot of warm colors as to show that cozy and sincere feeling.
