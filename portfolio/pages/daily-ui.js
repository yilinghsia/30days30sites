			<h2>About the challenge</h2>
			<p className="intro">
				The Daily UI challenge is a 100-days challenge where you create designs based on prompts that are sent via email.
				I started participating in November 2018 because it seemed fun but I expect that it would also give me the necessary practise to improve my skills.
				Currently as i'm writing this, I haven't finished the challenge yet. So, in a type of dear diary style, I will update and keep track of the challenge here weekly!

				I will admit that doing a prompt daily turned out to be more like "2 prompts a day to catch up because I didn't have time yesterday" 
				Nonetheless, the first week is over and i'm right on track! I had a lot of fun with the prompts once I started working on them.
				I played around with gradients and colors while trying to understand the well-known duotone effect that you see in <a target="_window" href="https://medium.com/@pierrellev/reproduce-colorizer-effect-of-spotify-71d5de88039f">Spotify's posters.</a>
