			<h2>About the challenge</h2>
			<p className="intro">
				The Daily UI challenge is a 100-days challenge where you create designs based on prompts that are sent via email.
				I started participating in November 2018 because it seemed fun but I expect that it would also give me the necessary practise to improve my skills.
				Currently as i'm writing this, I haven't finished the challenge yet. So, in a type of dear diary style, I will update and keep track of the challenge here weekly!

				I will admit that doing a prompt daily turned out to be more like "2 prompts a day to catch up because I didn't have time yesterday" 
				Nonetheless, the first week is over and i'm right on track! I had a lot of fun with the prompts once I started working on them.
				I played around with gradients and colors while trying to understand the well-known duotone effect that you see in <a target="_window" href="https://medium.com/@pierrellev/reproduce-colorizer-effect-of-spotify-71d5de88039f">Spotify's posters.</a>

					 Second week done! This week was about having fun with the prompts and I think you can see some of it in the designs. To be honest
					 these designs are my favorite so far. Something else that happened was that I continued making app designs, something i'm usually not involved with.
					 Besides a project in school I haven't really made any other designs for apps so making my view "smaller" allowed me to think more creatively about how I wanted to display things.

					  This week I tried to work on making designs appear more spacious with the help of spacing and accent colors. I believe i've read somewhere before that you have to do something for 20-60 days consistently to form a new habit. 
					I'm not sure how much truth is in that but if it's true, I think i'm a quarter in into forming this habit. Making a design every day consistently is proving challenging at times  
					but it's definitely good practise and motivating to see your designs in a row like this!
