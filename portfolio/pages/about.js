	<h2>So, how did you end up here?</h2>
		<p>
		 When I was a young girl I started spending a lot of time in making my own website. 
		 Although that website doesn't exist anymore (which i'm partially happy about since it was clearly
		 made by a small kid), I went on to study IT.
		<br/><br/>
		  I was always interested in making things look nice, but
		 during the first few years of my bachelor I didn't spend too much time on it, because well,
		 projects needed to be finished, assignments had to be done and college had to be attended.
		 It was only during an internship interview that I was rudely woken up. The interviewer had 
		 just seen one of my projects and said: "Well, it's ugly but it works right?". So that's when I started getting
	 	 into learning about User Experience, Usability, typography and color theory.
		 	<br/><br/>

		 	Because I believe that you should always be learning, i'm currently doing some programming/design challenges.
		 	In fact, I made this very portfolio website for the first prompt of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codelegy.com/30days30sites/">"30 days 30 sites"</a> challenge in HTML, CSS and Next.js!
		 	I plan to document my challenge journey on this website, so keep an eye out for it in my portfolio.
