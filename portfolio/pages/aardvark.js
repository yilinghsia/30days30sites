			<p className="intro">
				Even though I had been working at EY for a while, I decided to go for a 10-week UI Design course in 2017 to sharpen my skills. I got a mentor assigned to me, who I met up with weekly over Skype to go through assignments with.
				There was a lot of material to prepare you for the ﬁnal assignment: a news website. I really enjoyed following this course because it allowed me to ask questions and discuss with another designer. In return I have a better understanding on certain topics and it was a good and much needed basics refresher.
				You can see this project here.

				During this course I had a bit of a hard time trying to determine the look for The Aardvark since there were really no requirements. In the course you could see what others before you made, which was mostly bright, light and very stylized designs. I wanted my design to differ from these because I wanted to experiment with a different style than my normal one. So my design for The Aardvark became a night theme with some neon accents. 
				After the course ﬁnished I didn’t stop playing around with the design, because I feel like the design that I handed in wasn’t quite there yet. The design you see here is the latest version of The Aardvark. I tweaked a bit of the color and fonts so that gives it a smoother look compared to the one I submitted back then.
