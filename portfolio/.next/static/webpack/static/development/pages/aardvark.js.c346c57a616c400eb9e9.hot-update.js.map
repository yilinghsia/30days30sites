I got a mentor assigned to me, who I met up with weekly over Skype to go through assignments with.\n\t\t\t\tThere was a lot of material to prepare you for the ﬁnal assignment: a news website. I really enjoyed following this course because it allowed me to ask questions and discuss with another designer. In return I have a better understanding on certain topics and it was a good and much needed basics refresher.\n\t\t\t\tYou can see this project here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<div className=\"project-challenge\">\n\t\t\t<h2>The challenge</h2>\n\t\t\t<div className=\"project-screens\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/static/images/hinoki-about.png\" alt=\"hinoki\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/static/images/hinoki-franchise.png\" alt=\"hinoki\"/>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThe old website was a standard template which sped up the design process but didn’t allow for a lot of customisation. The tricky part for me was trying to incorporate Hinoki’s current brand that they’ve developed into the design which I would describe as oriental, warm, casual, sincere and masculine.\n\t\t\t\tIn order to create the same vibe as the restaurant, I incorporated a lot of the restaurant’s elements into the webdesign. I went with a dark theme with a lot of warm colors as to show that cozy and sincere feeling.\n\t\t\t</p> \n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t)"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAnBA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
