I was always interested in making things look nice, but\n\t\t during the first few years of my bachelor I didn't spend too much time on it, because well,\n\t\t projects needed to be finished, assignments had to be done and college had to be attended.\n\t\t It was only during an internship interview that I was rudely woken up. The interviewer had \n\t\t just seen one of my projects and said: \"Well, it's ugly but it works right?\". And that's when I started getting\n\t\t into design.\n\t\t </p>\n\t\t<img src=\"/static/images/yi.png\" alt=\"Picture Yi Ling Hsia\"/>\n\t</div>\n\t)"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAbA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
