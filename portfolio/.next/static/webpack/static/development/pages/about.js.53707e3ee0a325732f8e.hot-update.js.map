The interviewer had \n\t\t\tjust seen one of my projects and said: \"Well, it's ugly but it works right?\". So that's when I started getting\n\t\t\tinto learning about User Experience, Usability, typography and color theory.\n\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\n\t\t\tBecause I believe that you should always be learning, i'm currently doing some programming/design challenges.\n\t\t\tIn fact, I made this very portfolio website for the first prompt of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.codelegy.com/30days30sites/\">\"30 days 30 sites\"</a> challenge in HTML, CSS and Next.js!\n\t\t\tI plan to document my challenge journey on this website, so keep an eye out for it in my portfolio.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/static/images/yi.png\" alt=\"Picture Yi Ling Hsia\"/>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t)"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AArBA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
