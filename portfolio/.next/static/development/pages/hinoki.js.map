While busy with opening up and getting into the business, the owners hadn’t yet put much thought into the identity of their brand besides that it should have a strong Japanese feeling.\n\t\t\t\tThis vague idea continued to flow into the design of the old homepage that was put together swiftly back then. After the designs were done, I put together a simple prototype with HTML, CSS and Javascript.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/static/images/hinoki-devices.png\" alt=\"Placeholder\"/>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div className=\"project-challenge\">\n\t\t<h2>The challenge</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThe old website was a standard template which sped up the design process but didn’t allow for a lot of customisation. The tricky part for me was trying to incorporate Hinoki’s current brand that they’ve developed into the design which I would describe as oriental, warm, casual, sincere and masculine.\n\t\t\t\tIn order to create the same vibe as the restaurant, I incorporated a lot of the restaurant’s elements into the webdesign. I went with a dark theme with a lot of warm colors as to show that cozy and sincere feeling.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t)","module.exports = dll_ecba6b44147cc8018369;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;AAAA;;;;;;;;;;;ACAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ACvBA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAZA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ACAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
